          Our research focuses on the refinement and advancement of high-throughput single-cell genomic techniques, aiming to unravel the intricacies of cancer evolution and the aging process. From both experimental and analytical viewpoints, we meld bioinformatics, engineering, and cutting-edge methodologies to address pivotal translational questions. These include early cancer diagnosis, molecular cancer subtyping, aging-related genetic markers, and genetic predispositions linked to hearing loss.
